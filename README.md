## Version Control & Secure Code Management

This project utilizes Git for version control and is hosted on GitHub. The repository can be accessed here:

üìå [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gerasoa/MyRecipeBook)

üõ†Ô∏è Git Workflow

‚úÖ Feature-Based Commits: Commits are made after implementing new features, bug fixes, or complex adjustments.

‚úÖ Main Branch Usage: The project is maintained on the main branch for stability.

‚úÖ Descriptive Commit Messages: Each commit follows a meaningful and structured format.

‚úÖ Secure Code Management

‚úÖ No sensitive data is committed: Credentials and private keys are stored securely.

‚úÖ .env and .gitignore: Used to prevent sensitive files from being included in the repository.

‚úÖ Security Review: The repository is regularly checked to ensure compliance with best security practices.


## Deployment

The application is deployed on Heroku and is accessible at:

[My Recipes Book](https://my-recipes-book-5149219e370b.herokuapp.com/)

### üõ† Deployment Process

The deployment was carried out using Heroku with the following steps:

1 - Prepare the application

 - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 - Set `DEBUG = False` for production.

 - Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include the Heroku app domain.

2 - Set up environment variables

The following variables were added to Heroku:

- CLOUDINARY_URL ‚Äì For media storage

- DATABASE_URL ‚Äì For database connection

- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 ‚Äì To prevent static file collection issues

- SECRET_KEY ‚Äì To ensure application security

3 - Deploy to Heroku

- Create a new Heroku app: heroku create my-recipes-book

- Set environment variables: heroku config:set VAR_NAME=value

- Push the project:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
git push heroku main
```

- Run database migrations: `heroku run python manage.py migrate`


## üîí Security Measures

‚úî `SECRET_KEY` and other sensitive credentials are stored securely as environment variables.

‚úî `.gitignore` is configured to exclude sensitive files.

‚úî `DEBUG = False` in production to enhance security.


## ‚úÖ Deployment Verification

After deployment, the application was tested to ensure:

- The functionality matches the local development version.

- Database connections and media storage work correctly.

- The UI and interactive features operate as expected.


## AI Assistance in Development ü§ñ

During the development of this project, I strategically used GitHub Copilot to assist in various aspects of the code creation process. Here‚Äôs how AI contributed:

1 - Code Creation & Refinement:

Copilot helped generate parts of the code, especially in complex areas, and suggested improvements for better code structure and readability. It also assisted in refining classes and optimizing the CSS for better organization.

Bug Detection & Fixing:

2 -  I encountered several bugs in the code, which were identified and corrected with the help of AI. Copilot played a crucial role in pinpointing semantic errors and suggesting corrections, ensuring smoother functionality.

3 - Content Creation & Testing:

AI also contributed to generating content for the site and testing core functionalities. This was particularly valuable in ensuring that key features were working as expected.

4 - Productivity & Efficiency Gains:

The use of AI drastically reduced development time, allowing for quicker debugging, content generation, and code optimization. The overall impact on productivity was significant, and I was able to focus on higher-level tasks with improved efficiency.
